    "Pole-dipole DC resistivity data are simulated over both a conductive and a resistive block. The background conductivity is $\\sigma_0$ = 0.01 S/m. The conductor has a conductivity of $\\sigma_c$ = 0.1 S/m and the resistor has a conductivity of $\\sigma_r$ = 0.001 S/m. Both blocks are oriented along the Northing direction and have x, y and z dimensions of 400 m, 1600 m and 320 m. Both blocks are buried at a depth of 160 m.\n",

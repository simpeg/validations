    "\n",
    "Here, we invert gravity anomaly data collected over a block within a homogeneous halfspace. We invert for a compact and blocky model using an iteratively re-weighted least-squares inversion approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The true model consists of a denser block (0.1 $g/cm^3$) within a halfspace (0 $g/cm^3$).\n",
    "The dimensions of the block in the x, y and z directions are all 200 m. The block is buried at a depth of 200 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data being inverted were generated using the [UBC-GIF GRAV3D v6.0.1 code](https://grav3d.readthedocs.io/en/v6.0/). Synthetic gravity data were simulated at a heigh 1 m above the surface within a 1000 m by 1000 m region; the center of which lied directly over the center of the block. Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.002 mGal were added to the synthetic data. Uncertainties of 0.002 mGal were assigned to the data before inverting."

    "[GG3D v6.0.1](https://gg3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a voxel cell gravity gradiometry forward modeling and inversion package developed by the UBC Geophysical Inversion Facility. This software is proprietary and can ONLY be acquired through appropriate [academic](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_academic) or [commerical](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_commercial) licenses. The numerical approach of the forward simulation is described in the [online manual's theory section](https://gg3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/theory.html). If you have a valid license, the steps for reproducing the simulating results are explained below. "

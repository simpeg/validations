    "\n",
    "Transient TEM data are simulated over a conductive 1D layered Earth. The Earth consists of 3 layers all with electrical conductivities of $\\sigma_1$ = $\\sigma_2$ = $\\sigma_3$ = 0.01 S/m. From the top layer down we define magnetic susceptibilities of $\\chi_1$ = 0 SI, $\\chi_2$ = 9 SI and $\\chi_3$ = 0 SI for the layers. The thicknesses of the top two layers are both 64 m.\n",

    "The transient response is simulated for x, y and z oriented magnetic dipoles at (0, 0, 5). The x, y and z components of H and dB/dt are simulated at (10, 0, 5). However, we only plot the data for horizontal coaxial, horizontal coplanar and vertical coplanar geometries."

    "\n",
    "Here we simulate the transient response from a conductive sphere in a vacuum. The sphere has a conductivity of $\\sigma$ = 10 S/m and a magnetic susceptibility of $\\chi$ = 9 SI. The center of the sphere is located at (0,0,-50) and has a radius of $a$ = 8 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transient response is simulated for x, y and z oriented magnetic dipoles at (-5, 0, 10). The x, y and z components of H and dB/dt are simulated at (5, 0, 10). However, we only plot the data for horizontal coaxial, horizontal coplanar and vertical coplanar geometries."
